# Admin Shell Access Requirements

## Desired Outcome

Enable administrators to access and monitor any terminal session directly from the Shelltender Admin portal for troubleshooting and support purposes. The system should provide read-only access by default with the ability to enable interactive mode for direct terminal input when needed.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

**SYSTEM-001**: The Shelltender Admin portal SHALL provide direct access to any active terminal session on the server.

**SYSTEM-002**: The system SHALL maintain the existing buffer and scrollback functionality for admin-accessed sessions.

**SYSTEM-003**: The system SHALL support multiple administrators viewing the same session simultaneously.

### Access Control Requirements

**ACCESS-001**: The system SHALL grant read-only access to terminal sessions by default for all admin users.

**ACCESS-002**: The system SHALL provide a toggle to enable interactive mode for authorized administrators.

**ACCESS-003**: WHEN an administrator enables interactive mode, THEN the system SHALL allow direct input to the terminal session.

**ACCESS-004**: The system SHALL log all admin access to terminal sessions including session ID, admin user, timestamp, and access mode (read-only or interactive).

### User Interface Requirements

**UI-001**: The admin portal SHALL display a list of all active terminal sessions with session metadata (ID, user, creation time, status).

**UI-002**: WHEN an administrator selects a session, THEN the system SHALL open a terminal viewer with the current session output.

**UI-003**: The terminal viewer SHALL display the full scrollback buffer available for the session.

**UI-004**: The terminal viewer SHALL provide standard terminal controls (copy, paste, search within buffer).

**UI-005**: WHEN in read-only mode, THEN the terminal viewer SHALL clearly indicate the read-only status.

**UI-006**: WHEN interactive mode is enabled, THEN the terminal viewer SHALL clearly indicate the interactive status and show a warning.

### Performance Requirements

**PERF-001**: The system SHALL stream terminal output to admin viewers in real-time with less than 100ms latency.

**PERF-002**: The system SHALL handle at least 10 concurrent admin viewers per session without degradation.

**PERF-003**: WHERE a session has a large scrollback buffer, THEN the system SHALL load the buffer progressively to maintain UI responsiveness.

### Security Requirements

**SEC-001**: The system SHALL authenticate admin users before granting access to any terminal session.

**SEC-002**: The system SHALL encrypt all terminal data transmitted between the server and admin portal.

**SEC-003**: WHEN interactive mode is enabled, THEN the system SHALL log all keystrokes sent by the administrator.

**SEC-004**: The system SHALL provide role-based access control to restrict interactive mode to specific admin roles.

### Integration Requirements

**INT-001**: The admin shell access SHALL integrate with the existing SessionManager without disrupting active user sessions.

**INT-002**: The system SHALL use the existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time communication.

**INT-003**: The admin terminal viewer SHALL reuse the existing Terminal component with appropriate modifications for admin mode.

### Audit Requirements

**AUDIT-001**: The system SHALL maintain an audit log of all admin session access with the following information:
- Admin user ID and username
- Session ID accessed
- Access timestamp
- Access mode (read-only or interactive)
- Duration of access
- Commands executed (if interactive mode)

**AUDIT-002**: WHERE an administrator executes commands in interactive mode, THEN the system SHALL record the full command and its output.

### Error Handling Requirements

**ERROR-001**: IF a session terminates while an admin is viewing it, THEN the system SHALL notify the admin and maintain access to the session buffer.

**ERROR-002**: IF the WebSocket connection fails, THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection without losing the viewing state.

**ERROR-003**: WHERE an admin attempts to access a non-existent session, THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

## Implementation Considerations

1. The admin shell access should be implemented as a separate module that interfaces with the existing SessionManager
2. Consider implementing a session proxy pattern to avoid direct manipulation of user sessions
3. The UI should clearly differentiate between user-owned sessions and admin viewing mode
4. Implement rate limiting for interactive mode to prevent accidental flooding of commands
5. Consider adding a "shadow mode" where admin keystrokes are shown to the session owner
